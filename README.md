🌘 Eclipse Explorer Dashboard
A Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for exploring solar eclipse data from 2000 BCE to 3000 CE using a geospatial interface and filtered visualizations.

📚 About the Dataset
This dataset is provided by NASA, it shows detailed records of solar and lunar eclipses occurrences and predictions between the years -1999 and +3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE). It includes key parameters like eclipse type, magnitude, path width, geographic coordinates, and duration.

Solar Eclipse Types
Partial Eclipse – Moon's penumbral shadow grazes Earth.

Annular Eclipse – Moon's antumbral shadow passes over Earth, leaving a visible ring.

Total Eclipse – Moon's umbral shadow covers the sun completely.

Hybrid Eclipse – Transition between annular and total eclipse, depending on location.

Lunar Eclipse Types
Penumbral Eclipse – The Moon passes through Earth's penumbral shadow, causing a subtle dimming of the Moon's surface.

Partial Eclipse – A portion of the Moon enters Earth's umbral shadow, resulting in a noticeable darkening of part of the Moon.

Total Eclipse – The entire Moon moves into Earth's umbral shadow, often turning a deep red color, commonly known as a "Blood Moon."
